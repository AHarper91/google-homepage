From starting with little knowledge, I feel like I've learend a lot from this, though it's not perfect, and I may come back to it, but want to crack on for now.

I would like to tweak my search bar and buttons to look more 'authentic' and work out a few thing regarding spacing of icons on my nav bar, however I've got the basics down, and feel like I've made a decent first attempt.

I need to take some tutorials of placing of elements, particuarly the use of flexbox, as I feel that would've come in handy here, however I wasn't able to utilise it fully.

Before starting, had inclination I'd be better suited towards back end, and still feel that to be the case, however will continue on with the course for front end for the moment, as I feel I'm learning lots, and I suspect it'll come in handy regardless.
